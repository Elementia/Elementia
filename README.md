# Elementia
*A solitary figure stands in the center of a clearing, holding across his chest a staff of gnarled oak. A dark cowl hides the man's features, giving him an eldritch aura - something almost sinister. You can't help but shiver. There's something... elemental in the air.*

Welcome to Elementia. The mod of elements, and magicks arcane.
